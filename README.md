# Stock Market Analysis and Price Prediction

This repository contains a Data Science project focused on stock market analysis and price prediction. The project utilizes Python and Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization. 

## Project Overview

In this project, I conducted comprehensive analysis on the stocks of four tech companies: Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. The project includes the following key components:

1. **Data Collection**: Data on historical stock prices and volumes for the four companies were gathered from Yahoo Finance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various visualization techniques were employed to analyze the stocks. This includes plotting time series data, exploring trends, and identifying patterns.

5. **Price Prediction using LSTM**: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model was implemented to predict the price of Google's stock. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequential data, making it suitable for time series forecasting tasks.
